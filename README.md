# Predicting Clients' Income Levels (Banking Data Mining Project)
## Overview

A data mining and machine learning project designed to help banking institutions (case study: ANZ Bank) predict clients’ income levels. The solution enables better marketing strategies, personalized banking services, and improved credit assessments.

## Tech Stack & Tools

Languages: Python (scikit-learn, PySpark), IBM SPSS Modeler

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Methods: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Class Balancing, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes

Skills Gained: Data preprocessing, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, CRISP-DM methodology

## Process

Data Preparation – Cleaned 32k+ records, handled missing values, removed outliers, created derived attributes (Net capital gain, Age group, Work intensity).

Modeling – Implemented and compared Decision Tree, Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes.

Evaluation – Measured performance with Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC.

## Results

Best Model: Decision Tree (scikit-learn)

Test Accuracy: 83.5%

F1 Score: 84.4%

ROC-AUC: 0.84

Insights: Education, marital status, and capital gains are strong predictors of income level.
